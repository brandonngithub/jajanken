## ~ rock-paper-scissors ~
<p>The third project from TheOdinProject (Foundations Course).</p>
<p>
A best of five rock, paper, scissors game programmed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate basic Javascript skills in combination with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A useful skill I learned in doing this project is how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
